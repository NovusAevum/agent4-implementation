   ```

### Step 3: Activate Agent 4

1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Type: **"Select AI Agent"**
3. Choose: **"Agent 4 Multi-LLM"**

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Code Generation
```
Prompt: "Create a REST API for user authentication with JWT"

Agent 4 Response:
[PHASE:PLAN] Starting analysis...
├── Requirement Analysis: REST API with JWT auth
├── Architecture Options:
│   ├── Option A: Express + JWT (Confidence: 90%)
│   ├── Option B: Fastify + JWT (Confidence: 75%)
│   └── DECISION: Express + JWT - Better ecosystem support
├── File Operations Planned:
│   ├── Create: src/auth/controller.ts
│   ├── Create: src/auth/middleware.ts
│   └── Modify: src/index.ts
└── User Approval: ✓

[PHASE:DISCOVER] Batch file analysis...
[BATCH] Reading 3 files: [package.json, src/index.ts, tsconfig.json]

[PHASE:EXECUTE] Multi-edit implementation...
[FILE:CREATE] src/auth/controller.ts
[FILE:CREATE] src/auth/middleware.ts
[FILE:WRITE] src/index.ts (added auth routes)
[MULTI:EDIT] Applied JWT pattern to 3 files

[PHASE:VALIDATE] Testing and verification...
[SELF-TEST] ✓ Auth routes respond correctly
[SELF-TEST] ✓ JWT validation works
[CHECKPOINT] Created checkpoint: auth-implementation-v1
```

### Example 2: Debugging
```
Prompt: "Fix the authentication bug in login endpoint"

Agent 4 Response:
[THINKING:START]
├── Problem Analysis: Login endpoint returns 500 error
├── Solution Options:
│   ├── Option A: Fix token expiration (Confidence: 60%)
│   ├── Option B: Fix password hashing (Confidence: 85%)
│   └── DECISION: Password hashing issue - bcrypt config
├── Implementation Strategy:
│   1. Read auth files
│   2. Identify bcrypt usage
│   3. Apply fix pattern
│   4. Self-test
└── Risk Assessment: Low - backward compatible
[THINKING:END]

[Executes 4-phase workflow with fix]
```

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Meta-Thinking
See the agent's decision-making process:
- Decision trees
- Confidence scores
- Trade-off analysis

### Batch Operations
The agent reads/writes multiple files simultaneously:
- 3-6 files per batch
- Pattern-based edits
- Atomic operations

### Checkpoints
Automatic project snapshots:
- After each phase
- Before risky operations
- Rollback support

### Multi-LLM Fallback
Automatic provider switching:
1. Hugging Face (primary)
2. Mistral AI (fallback 1)
3. DeepSeek (fallback 2)
4. OpenRouter (fallback 3)
5. Codestral (fallback 4)

## 🎨 UI Features

### Real-Time Progress
```
[PROGRESS] Phase 2/4: DISCOVER (45% complete)
[STATUS] Analyzing dependencies...
[FILE] READ: src/utils/helper.ts (2.3KB)
[BATCH] Reading 5 files...
[PATTERN] Found common error handling pattern
[DECISION] Use centralized error handler - Better maintainability
[CONFIDENCE] 92% - Based on project structure
```

### Clickable Links
- File paths are clickable
- Jump to errors
- Navigate to checkpoints

### Decision Trees
Visual representation of agent's thinking:
```
├── Should we refactor now?
│   ├── Yes (70%) - Code complexity high
│   │   └── Benefits: Better maintainability
│   └── No (30%) - Time constraints
│       └── Risk: Technical debt
└── DECISION: Yes - Long-term benefits
```

## 📊 Status Monitoring

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Current Provider
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/agent4/status
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Agent not responding
```bash
# Check if server is running
lsof -i :3000

# Restart server
cd /Users/wmh/CascadeProjects/agent4-implementation
npm start
```

### Issue: Provider failures
The agent will automatically fallback to next provider. Check logs:
```bash
tail -f logs/agent4.log
```

### Issue: Slow responses
Check which provider is active:
- Hugging Face: Fast (~2-3s)
- Mistral: Fast (~2-4s)
- DeepSeek: Medium (~4-6s)
- OpenRouter: Medium (~3-5s)

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific
❌ "Make this better"
✅ "Refactor the authentication logic to use async/await"

### 2. Provide Context
```
"I'm building an e-commerce API. Create a product catalog endpoint 
with pagination, filtering by category, and price sorting."
```

### 3. Use Build Modes
- **Build Mode**: Full implementation
- **Plan Mode**: Architecture discussion only
- **Edit Mode**: Precise modifications

### 4. Request Meta-Thinking
```
"Explain your architectural decision for using Redis vs. in-memory cache"
```

## 🔐 Security

All API keys are:
- Stored in `.env` (gitignored)
- Never exposed to client
- Encrypted in transit
- Auto-rotated (optional)

## 📈 Performance Metrics

Expected response times:
- Plan phase: < 5s
- Discover phase: < 10s
- Execute phase: < 15s
- Validate phase: < 5s
- Total workflow: < 35s

## 🌟 Pro Tips

1. **Use checkpoints**: Request checkpoint before risky operations
2. **Batch operations**: Let agent read multiple files at once
3. **Meta-thinking**: Ask for reasoning on complex decisions
4. **Self-testing**: Agent validates its own work
5. **Pattern edits**: Apply fixes to similar code across files

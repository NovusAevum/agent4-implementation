## 🔧 Technical Details

### Dockerfile Configuration

**Optimizations**:
- Multi-stage build (builder + production)
- Non-root user (myuser)
- Production-only dependencies
- Health check endpoint
- Port 7860 (HF Spaces standard)

**Build Process**:
```dockerfile
Stage 1 (Builder):
- Install build dependencies
- Copy source files
- Run npm ci
- Build TypeScript → JavaScript

Stage 2 (Production):
- Minimal runtime image
- Copy built files
- Install production deps only
- Configure health check
- Expose port 7860
```

### Environment Variables

**Set in HF Space**:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=7860
DEFAULT_LLM_PROVIDER=huggingface
AGENT4_ENABLED=true
```
